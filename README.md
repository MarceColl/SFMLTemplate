# SFML Scaffolding #

## First steps ##

```shell
$ mkdir build/
$ cd build/
$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../
$ make
```

then you will have a executable file `ggj2017` in the `build/` folder.

## Requirements ##
We use 4 libraries, `imgui`, `imgui-sfml`, `sol2` and `SFML`. Of these the only one you need to install in your system is `SFML`.
